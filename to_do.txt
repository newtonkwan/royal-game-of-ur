Things to complete for the royal game of ur project 

- create the 3x4 version of the game that can be played by people in the terminal. 2/2/19 
- create an agent that plays 3x4 randomly against each other. 2/2/19 
- pit randomly playing agents against each other and see how they do 2/2/19
- pit the human and random agent against each other 2/2/19

- create an agent that has basic strategy, like prioritizing getting to the end vs. prioritizing sending pieces back
- pit various agents to play against each other
- reformat the the game_logic to make it easier to use 
- create the full 3x8 with flowers and 0-4 roll version of the game that can be played by two people in the terminal
- create an agent that plays 3x8 randomly.
- create a version of the game that allows you to play against the random agent 
- create an agent that plays the game with a few heuristics
- create a version of the game that allows you to play against the agent that plays with a few heuristics 
- create an agent that plays using optimal play (meaning pick the move with the highest probability of winning)
- create an agent that learns to play optimally using reinforcement learning 

Here we gooooo
